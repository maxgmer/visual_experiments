# Visual experiments
My experiments with drawing interesting things using only code and primitives!

I have created this repository to share my experiments with Java and primitives. 
I use Processing 3 library to get rid of mandatory Java code and make it more readable for you! :)

To run my visualisations: 
1. Download the repository.
2. Open any directory (each contains a different visualisation project).
3. Open a folder for your operating system and run the root file there (e.g. Visualisation.exe for windows).
4. Enjoy! :)
